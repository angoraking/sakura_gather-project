AWS IAM User Setup Library for Open Source Projects

This module provides automated IAM user credential setup for open source projects
that need AWS access in their CI/CD pipelines. While OIDC (OpenID Connect) is the
most secure approach for AWS authentication from GitHub Actions, this library
offers a simpler, more automated alternative that's suitable for rapid deployment
and testing scenarios.

The primary motivation for this approach is to provide:

- Automated IAM user creation with minimal required permissions
- Seamless integration with GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows  
- Quick setup for open source projects without complex OIDC configuration
- Proper cleanup capabilities to avoid resource accumulation

Security considerations:

- IAM users have long-lived credentials (less secure than temporary OIDC tokens)
- Permissions are scoped to the minimum required for the specific use case
- Access keys are stored securely in GitHub Secrets (encrypted at rest)
- Cleanup methods ensure resources don't persist unnecessarily

This approach trades some security for simplicity and automation, making it ideal
for open source projects that need quick AWS integration without the overhead
of OIDC setup and management.

    pip install "boto_session_manager>=1.7.2,<2.0.0"

    Automated IAM User Setup for GitHub Actions Integration

    This class orchestrates the complete lifecycle of IAM user credentials for
    open source projects. It addresses the common challenge of securely providing
    AWS access to GitHub Actions workflows without the complexity of OIDC setup.

    The automation handles both setup and cleanup phases, ensuring that credentials
    are properly managed throughout their lifecycle. This is particularly important
    for open source projects where multiple contributors may need to manage AWS
    resources but shouldn't have access to long-lived credentials.

    Key automation benefits:

    - Eliminates manual IAM user creation and policy attachment
    - Automatically configures GitHub Secrets with proper naming conventions
    - Provides idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)
    - Includes comprehensive cleanup to prevent credential sprawl

    Security design principles:

    - Principle of least privilege (minimal required permissions only)
    - Automated credential rotation capability through recreate operations
    - Clear separation between setup and teardown operations
    - GitHub Secrets integration for secure credential storage
